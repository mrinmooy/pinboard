BASIC STUFF:

insert mode, press i
for command mode, press esc
in command mode,
	:w! to force save
	:q! to force exit
	:e! to go back to previous save
for moving up and down, in command mode, press h,j,k,l
to move to any linem in command mode, press 10G to move to 10th line
use w to move to next word, in middle of the word use e to move to the end, use b to move to previous word
use W and B to move by complete word, including punctuation marks and symbols
in insert mode, use backspace to to delete text and enter for new line
	like insert mode with i, we have a for append, c for change(which basically highlights text), combine c with w or b or 0 or $)
	like cw, c0, c$, etc, (A is $a in command mode)
r to replace just one character, stays in command mode
s to replace more than one character like 13s to replace 13 next characters
some commands have their uppercase counterpart, not that complex, you can figure it out by experimenting
d deletes, dw to delete next one word, dd to delete entire line 
y for yank
p for put ( can be used after delete or yank )
u undoes the latest change (in command mode)
U restores the whole line
x deleted just a single character 
d deletes, p puts, y yanks(copy),
( capital) J joins lines (these can be prefixed with numbers and suffixed with w or b)
CTRL + D to scroll half a screen down
CTRL + U to scroll half a screen up

Advanced stuff:
use ~ to change toggle upper case and lower case
